# express-htmx
Learning how to create htmx apps using javascript. This is based on https://codecapsules.io/tutorial/building-a-full-stack-application-with-express-and-htmx/ .

As my background is Java and Python, backend dev, the javascript might look a bit awkward still.




## Updates
As compared to the tutorial:

- index.pug : <each book in books> has become `each book in books`.
- added todo for ordering. I'd rather listen after the callbacks have been registered.
